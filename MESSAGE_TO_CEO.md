Hey [CEO Name],

Saw your post about the Senior Engineer role at PayGood. Rather than just send a resume, I built an analytics dashboard to show how I think about product development for mission-driven companies.

ðŸ”— Live Demo: [your-vercel-link]
ðŸ’» GitHub: [your-repo]

What I built:
- Real-time transaction monitoring & analytics
- Geographic distribution tracking
- Mission-specific metrics (Zakat collection, recurring giving)
- Payment method breakdown
- 30-day volume trends

Tech: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Recharts, Tailwind

Why this matters:
PayGood isn't just another payment processorâ€”it's solving real discrimination in banking. I included features like Zakat tracking and recurring donation analytics because they align with your community's needs.

Background:
- 5+ years building production systems (Python/FastAPI, React, ML)
- Recent projects: AI-powered restaurant analytics platform, fitness tracking app
- Portfolio: [your link]

I'd love to discuss how I can help scale PayGood's infrastructure and build features that serve your community.

Available for a call this week.

Best,
Osama
